2-star,"My husband and I had a rare afternoon off so we decided to try this place. I had been here once before with my friend for drinks after work and enjoyed. We sat down and the waitress gave us the entire menu, no explanation or indication that the whole menu was not available. We were going to order some food (late lunch, about 2:30) and the waitress came back and said the kitchen was closed. Okay, no big deal, we'll have some wine and find a place to eat in the area afterward. The first page on the menu was their Happy Hour deals. The menu very clearly states Happy Hour, Monday through Friday until 7:50. Cute. The wines were $7.50 per glass. My husband and I both pointed to wines on the front cover of the menu (the ""Happy Hour"" menu). When I got the bill, we were charged full price for the wines. I asked the waitress and she said ""Oh, happy hour doesn't start until 4:00."" Yet NO WHERE on the menu does it say that. In fact, the menu does not indicate any start time, only an end time. Not only that, but the waitress could clearly see that we were ordering from the Happy Hour menu (we did the dumb pointing at names thing). She should have mentioned at that time that the wines would be full price. Instead, she kind of laughed it off and said we probably should put 4:00 on there and I said you absolutely should. I will not be returning or recommending."

Okay, no big deal, we'll have some wine and find a place to eat in the area afterward. The first page on the menu was their Happy Hour deals. The menu very clearly states Happy Hour, Monday through Friday until 7:50. Cute. The wines were $7.50 per glass. My husband and I both pointed to wines on the front cover of the menu (the ""Happy Hour"" menu). When I got the bill, we were charged full price for the wines. I asked the waitress and she said ""Oh, happy hour doesn't start until 4:00."" Yet NO WHERE on the menu does it say that. In fact, the menu does not indicate any start time, only an end time. Not only that, but the waitress could clearly see that we were ordering from the Happy Hour menu (we did the dumb pointing at names thing). She should have mentioned at that time that the wines would be full price. Instead, she kind of laughed it off and said we probably should put 4:00 on there and I said you absolutely should. I will not be returning or recommending."
2-star,"My husband and I had a rare afternoon off so we decided to try this place. I had been here once before with my friend for drinks after work and enjoyed. We sat down and the waitress gave us the entire menu, no explanation or indication that the whole menu was not available. We were going to order some food (late lunch, about 2:30) and the waitress came back and said the kitchen was closed.

4-star,I'm don't eat a chains much but I'll stop in to my neighborhood Applebee's when I'm feeling it. This location in particular is great! The staff is attentive and they care about your experience. That Kind of service honestly makes the meal a little bit better. I usually get the 2 for 25$ with my buddy and it's honestly an amazing deal.
